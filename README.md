Skim [ ![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jfirebaugh/skim.png) ](https://travis-ci.org/jfirebaugh/skim)
====

Take the fat out of your client-side templates with Skim. Skim is the [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) templating engine
with embedded CoffeeScript. It compiles to JavaScript templates (`.jst`), which can then be served by Rails or any other
Sprockets-based asset pipeline.

# Usage

`gem install skim`, or add `skim` to your `Gemfile` in the `:assets` group:

```ruby
group :assets do
  gem 'skim'
end
```

Create template files with the extension `.jst.skim`. For example, `test.jst.skim`:

```jade
p Hello #{@world}!
```

In your JavaScript or CoffeeScript, render the result, passing a context object:

```js
$("body").html(JST["test"]({world: "World"}));
```

Order up a skinny latte and enjoy!

# Caveats

Skim is an early proof-of-concept. Some Slim features are still missing:

* Skim does not currently support embedded engines. Being a client-side templating languages, it will only be able to
  support embedded engines with a client-side implementation.
* Skim does not currently support HTML pretty-printing (Slim's `:pretty` option). This is low priority, as
  pretty-printing is even less important client-side than server-side.
* Skim does not currently support backslash line continuations.

# Language reference

Skim supports the following Slim language features:

* doctype declarations (`doctype`)
* HTML Comments (`/!`) and conditional comments (`/[...]`)
* static content (same line and nested)
* dynamic content, escaped and not (`=` and `==`)
* control logic (`-`)
* string interpolation, escaped and not (`#{}` and `#{{}}`)
* id and class attribute shortcuts (`#` and `.`)
* attribute and attribute value wrappers
* logic-less (sections) mode

Several Coffee/JavaScript considerations are specific to Skim:

* When interpolating the results of evaluating code, Skim will replace `null` and `undefined` results with an empty
string.
* You will typically want to use the fat arrow `=>` function definition to create callbacks, to preserve the binding of
`this` analogously to how `self` behaves in a Ruby block.

## The context object

The context object you pass to the compiled template function becomes the value of this inside your template. You can
use CoffeeScript's `@` sigil to easily access properties and call helper methods on the context object.

## Escaping and unescaping

Like Slim, Skim escapes dynamic output by default, and it supports the same `==` and `#{{}}` syntaxes for bypassing
escaping. In addition, the special `safe` method on the context object tells Skim that the string can be output without
being escaped. You can use this in conjunction with `escape` context method to selectively sanitize parts of the string.
For example, given the template:

```jade
= @linkTo(@project)
```

you could render it with the following context:

```jade
JST["my_template"]
  project: { id: 4, name: "Crate & Barrel" }
  linkTo: (project) ->
    url  = "/projects/#{project.id}"
    name = @escape project.name
    @safe "<a href='#{url}'>#{name}</a>"
```

to produce:

```html
<a href='/projects/4'>Crate &amp; Barrel</a>
```

## The Skim asset

By default, all you need to do to start using Skim is add it to your Gemfile. Skim will embed a small amount of
supporting code in each generated template asset. You can remove this duplication by manually including Skim's asset,
and setting Skim's `:use_asset` option to true.

In Rails, this can be done by adding the following to `application.js`:

```js
//= require skim
```

And the following in an initializer:

```ruby
Skim::Engine.default_options[:use_asset] = true
```
